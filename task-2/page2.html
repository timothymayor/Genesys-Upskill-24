    <h3>What distinguishes normal HTML elements from semantic HTML elements?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Normal HTML elements</strong> are those that are used to define the structure and appearance of a web page without conveying any specific meaning or purpose. <br />
        Examples of normal HTML elements include <br />
        <ul>
            <li>div</li>
            <li>span</li>
            <li>b</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Semantic HTML elements</strong> on the other hand, are specifically designed to convey meaning to both the browser and the developer. <br />
        These elements provide information about the content they wrap, making the HTML more descriptive and easier to understand for both humans and machines. <br />
        Examples of semantic HTML elements include <br />
        <ul>
            <li>header</li>
            <li>footer</li>
            <li>section</li>
            <li>article</li>
            <li>nav</li>
            <li>main</li>
            <li>aside</li>
            <li>figure</li>
            <li>figcaption</li>
        </ul>
        By using semantic HTML elements, developers can improve the accessibility, SEO, and maintainability of their web pages.

    <h3>Explain the disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags in HTML</h3>
    <p>
        In HTML, most elements have a start tag to indicate the beginning of the element's content and an end tag to indicate the end of the element's content. 

        For example:
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

        In contrast, self-closing tags are used for elements that do not have any content or do not require separate closing tags. Instead, these elements can be closed within the start tag itself. 

        For example:
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">

        In this case, the <img> tag is self-closed because it doesn't have any content to enclose. 
        Similarly, other elements like <br>, <hr>, and <input> are also self-closing.

        It's important to note that in HTML, the use of self-closing tags is required for some elements, while for others, it's a matter of preference or best practice.

    <h3>What distinguishes inline elements from block elements in HTML?</h3>
    <p>
        In HTML, block-level elements and inline elements differ in their behavior and how they interact with other elements on the page.

        Block-level elements:
        <ul>
            <li>Typically start on a new line and take up the full width available.</li>
            <li>
                Examples of block-level elements include <div>, <p>, <h1>, <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <form>.
            </li>
            <li>They can contain other block-level and inline elements.</li>
        </ul>

        Inline elements:
        <ul>
            <li>Do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.</li>
            <li>Examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>.</li>
            <li>They do not force a new line to begin after them.</li>
            <li>They can only contain other inline elements or data.</li>
        </ul>

        Understanding the distinction between block-level and inline elements is important for controlling the layout and structure of a webpage. <br />
        Additionally, there are elements that have been introduced in HTML5, such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, and <aside>, <br />
        which are considered "block-level" for the purpose of layout and structure, <br />
        but also bring semantic meaning to the content contained within them.<br />
