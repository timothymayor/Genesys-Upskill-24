## Week 3 Task

1. The design has a large background-image. You can find and download an image you want to use for that section. Be sure to credit the creator of your image!

2. Pick an external font. You can use any font you like.

3. Do not worry about making your project look nice on mobile, but DO resize your browser a little bit to make sure that itâ€™s not completely broken at different desktop resolutions.

4. For the radio button, use Genesys Upskill instead of GeeksForGeeks.
